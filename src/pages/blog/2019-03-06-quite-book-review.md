Quite is a book about introverts. Core take-aways for me are that there are more introverts than we think and they often can be difficult to spot. Introversion doesn't have a clear cut definition and depends a lot on situational context. However, it's important in a management position to understand and identify introverted tendencies for two main reasons: to give each person the space and opportunity they need to make an impact, and to give each person the time and isolation they need to be optimize output.

## Speaking Up

Introverts by definition are less likely to speak up. Not because they don't have something to say, but because they have an extra underlying cost to being social. These people often think hard about  subjects and can bring some of the best ideas to the table. In meetings it's important to make sure everyone has an opportunity to contribute.

## Alone Time

Weather it's working from home, going to a coffee shop for a few hours, or just do not disturb headphones time, it's important for introverts to be isolated for long periods of time to let their true potential shine.
