Everyone should be a teacher because everyone needs to be learning. Everyone is somewhat self-taught, even when a teacher is involved. It's important to know how you learn best and to carve out dedicated time to invest in your own learning and growth.

But even with this mindset there are things you can learn that are less useful and don't necessarily lead to becoming an expert or proficient in something. Like passively watching sitcoms or reading romance novels will not yield the same value as reading a science or technology book or watching conference talks.

## Becoming an Expert

What's the difference between an expert and an amateur? 

Someone is an expert when their **intuition** is highly accurate. We all have intuition but most of the time we're on the first part of the dunning-kruger curve and actually get things quite wrong for anything of reasonable complexity. However, over time and with the right guidance we can hone in our intuition to make it more accuate. The expert is simply the one who consistently has the best answer first.

Three conditions to building accurate intuition:

1. Reliable patterns (e.g. chess, not the stock market)
2. Immediate Feedback
3. Lots of practice

On top of this, experts have **well-organized knolwedge**

* **Organization** supports understanding, not simple recall
* Knowledge of the subjects **foundational concepts** not situational happenstance

Experts have adaptive metacognitive skills allowing them to transfer knowledge from one setting to another easily. Foundational concepts often apply across many subjects making this easier.

## Teacher vs Expert

As experts already have accurate intuition they can often jump right over multiple steps that the novice has yet to encounter. Identifying those steps is what makes someone more than an expert, it makes them a **teacher**. To do this the teacher must first identify the base foundational knowledge of the student and incrementally build on it to bridge each gap.

To ensure teaching adaptive knowledge and not simple situational recall, the teacher tests and applies the foundational concepts in different settings and engages with the student encouraging them to express their thought process.

Teachers give instant feedback and practice repetition. Uncover any mis-conceptions or incomplete understandings and correct them.

Finally, teachers need to develop the ability for self-assessment and self learning in the students. Help them reflect and rethink each step for a better understanding. A teachers work is done when the student becomes the teacher and the understanding is clear that we are all students and all teachers.

## Building a Community

Foster norms for people learning from one another, and continually attempting to improve. Students are encouraged to be active, constructive participants - make mistakes and learn from them. Intellectual camaraderie fosters support, challenge, and collaboration.
