The concept of starting fresh is powerful. When you've been faced with a bug or difficult problem for a while, the mind can get stuck in a loop.

Practice simply starting over. Go back to the goal or problem statement and whiteboard the solution from scratch.

A short break can also help. Go somewhere you don't normally go. Walking in nature will help. Don't get a snack or start another project. Simply give your mind a rest. It doesn't take long (~10-20 minutes), but don't let your mind wander into a new problem.

Come back fresh and start again.
